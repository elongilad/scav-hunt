# Important Notes:
# 1. NEVER commit this file with real values to version control
# 2. In Vercel, set these as environment variables in the dashboard
# 3. For local development, save as .env.local in your project root
# 4. The URLs and keys are project-specific and cannot be shared between projects

# Deployment-specific variables (set these in Vercel dashboard):
# - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
# - Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
# - Add each variable with its corresponding value
# - Redeploy your application after adding variables

# Security Best Practices:
# - Use different Supabase projects for development and production
# - Regularly rotate API keys if needed
# - Enable Row Level Security (RLS) in production if handling sensitive data
# - Monitor usage in Supabase dashboard for unusual activity
