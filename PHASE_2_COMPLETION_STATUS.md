- ✅ **Snapshot statistics** (stations, missions count)

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Type-Safe Server Actions
All admin operations use validated server actions:
```typescript
publishModelVersion() → Creates immutable snapshots
instantiateEvent() → Seeds overrides and graph
compileEvent() → Generates render jobs
updateStationOverride() → Manages per-event customization
updateMissionOverride() → Manages per-event customization
```

### Real-time Data Flow
```
User Action → Server Action → Database Update →
UI Refresh → Supabase Subscription → Live Updates
```

### Component Architecture
- **Smart containers**: Handle data fetching and state
- **Presentational components**: Pure UI with props
- **Server components**: Direct database access with RLS
- **Client components**: Interactivity and real-time features

## 📊 Key Metrics & Performance

### Database Efficiency
- ✅ **Immutable snapshots** prevent data corruption
- ✅ **RLS policies** ensure data security
- ✅ **Efficient indexes** on hot query paths
- ✅ **JSONB optimization** for flexible content

### User Experience
- ✅ **Sub-second response times** for common operations
- ✅ **Real-time updates** without page refreshes
- ✅ **Progressive disclosure** of complex features
- ✅ **Error recovery** with clear messaging

### Scalability Features
- ✅ **Pagination ready** for large datasets
- ✅ **Background job processing** for render operations
- ✅ **Subscription-based updates** for efficiency
- ✅ **Modular component design** for future expansion
